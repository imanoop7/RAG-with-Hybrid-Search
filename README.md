# RAG with Hybrid Search

Welcome to the "RAG with Hybrid Search" repository! In this project, we explore the combination of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and hybrid search techniques to enhance information retrieval and context-aware document summarization.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architectural approach that enhances the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating information retrieval (search) into the text generation process. Specifically, RAG combines the strengths of both LLMs and external knowledge sources to improve the quality and relevance of generated responses.

## Features

- **BM25 and Ensemble Retriever**: The `BM25_and_ensemble_retriever.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to set up a hybrid search system using BM25 (a popular information retrieval algorithm) and an ensemble of retrievers.
- **RAG with Hybrid Search**: The `RAG_with_hybrid_search.ipynb` notebook focuses on incorporating RAGs into the search process for context-aware summarization.
- **Implementation in Python**: The `rag_with_hybrid_search.py` script provides a Python implementation of the RAG-based hybrid search.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/RAG-with-Hybrid-Search.git
   cd RAG-with-Hybrid-Search

2. Install the necessary dependencies (see requirements.txt).
3. Explore the notebooks and Python script to understand the hybrid search approach.

## Usage
- Use the BM25_and_ensemble_retriever.ipynb notebook to set up and evaluate  
  the hybrid search system.
- Experiment with the RAG_with_hybrid_search.ipynb notebook to see how RAGs
  improve context-aware summarization.
- Integrate the rag_with_hybrid_search.py script into your own projects.
